Problem 1.
Show that it is possible to buy exactly 50, 51, 52, 53, 
54, and 55 McNuggets, by finding solutions to the 
Diophantine equation.  You can solve this in your head, 
using paper and pencil, or writing a program.  
However you chose to solve this problem, list the combinations 
of 6, 9 and 20 packs of McNuggets you need to buy in order to 
get each of the exact amounts.
Given that it is possible to buy sets of 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 or 
55 McNuggets by combinations of 6, 9 and 20 packs, show that it 
is possible to buy 56, 57,…, 65 McNuggets.  In other words, show 
how, given solutions for 50-55, one can derive solutions for 56-65.

Theorem:  If it is possible to buy x, x+1,…, x+5 sets of McNuggets, 
for some x, then it is possible to buy any number of McNuggets >= x, 
given that McNuggets come in 6, 9 and 20 packs. 

Problem 2.
Explain, in English, why this theorem is true. 

Problem 3.
Write an iterative program that finds the largest number of McNuggets 
that cannot be bought in exact quantity.  Your program should print the 
answer in the following format (where the correct number is provided in 
place of <n>): 
“Largest number of McNuggets that cannot be bought in exact quantity: <n>”
